Backlog:
    
    
    check off itmes enter + arrow keys
    
    login
    database to store data
    Make instructions better(have first time be tutorial)
    Strings being coppied should instead be use as reference( what should be String and what &str)


Complete:
Store data differently, instead of having titles and todolist combine them
        Work:
        1: DONE Tab Type will be used to specify which input is being used
        2: DONE Keys will need to access the two input boxes
        3: DONEInput 1 will add a new todo list, input 2 will add a new todo Item to the active list
        4: DONE put curser into correct position
        5: DONERemove titles from state
        6: DONETwo lists will be rendered
            1: loop through todolists.name
            2: loop through todolists[index].item_name
